- Use `~~` to strike through text
- Use `#` to create headings
- Use `-` to create bullet points
- Use `[link text](link URL)` to create a hyperlink

### Code Blocks

To create a code block, you can use three backticks (```) before and after your code:



This will produce a block of code that is formatted and syntax-highlighted:



### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

## Tips for using Markdown

Here are some tips for using Markdown in your README file:

- Use `**` to bold text
- Use `_` to italicize text
- Use `~~` to strike through text
- Use `#` to create headings
- Use `-` to create bullet points
- Use `[link text](link URL)` to create a hyperlink

### Code Blocks

To create a code block, you can use three backticks (```) before and after your code:



This will produce a block of code that is formatted and syntax-highlighted:



### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

- Use `~~` to strike through text
- Use `#` to create headings
- Use `-` to create bullet points
- Use `[link text](link URL)` to create a hyperlink

### Code Blocks

To create a code block, you can use three backticks (```) before and after your code:



This will produce a block of code that is formatted and syntax-highlighted:



### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

## Tips for using Markdown

Here are some tips for using Markdown in your README file:

- Use `**` to bold text
- Use `_` to italicize text
- Use `~~` to strike through text
- Use `#` to create headings
- Use `-` to create bullet points
- Use `[link text](link URL)` to create a hyperlink

### Code Blocks

To create a code block, you can use three backticks (```) before and after your code:



This will produce a block of code that is formatted and syntax-highlighted:



### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

### Code Blocks

To create a code block, you can use three backticks (```) before and after your code:



This will produce a block of code that is formatted and syntax-highlighted:



### Tables

You can create tables by using the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate columns, and a series of dashes (`-`) to create a line of separation between the column headings and the table rows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

This will produce a table that looks like this:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

### Custom HTML

You can also use custom HTML in your Markdown file if you need to use an advanced formatting feature that is not supported by native Markdown. For example, to create an anchor link that jumps to a specific heading on the page, you can use the following HTML:

<a href="#tips-for-using-markdown">Jump to Tips for using Markdown</a>

This will produce a link that looks like this:

[Jump to Tips for using Markdown](#tips-for-using-markdown)

I hope these examples are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
